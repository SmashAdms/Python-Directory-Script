# Python-Exercise-Directory-Script
For this project I created a Python script that used the OS and Shutil modules to find files in a specific folder that contain a specific string and copies these files into the current working directory.
The shutil module is a Python module used for high-level file operations like moving and copying. 
I create a script called copy_activities.py with a function called stu_activities that:
Finds files in ~/Downloads that contain the string Stu_Copies these files into the current working directory.
This Python script was a big time saver. This script allowed me to move over 60 files containing a specif string and move them instantly into a new folder.
